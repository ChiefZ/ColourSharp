ColourSharp
===========

ColourSharp started off as a simple VB.Net program to send a value through a serial port to a Arduino board to turn a LED on and off. I used my friends Aero Visualizer project which changed the Aero colour and made it more advanced and added dynamic colours based on the incoming FFT stream. A video can be found here:
